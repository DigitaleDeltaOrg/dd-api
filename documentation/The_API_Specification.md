The API specification consists of two parts.  

* The _Types_ section describes the data types that are available for the resources. The figure below shows an overview of the resource objects and there relations.  
_Note 1_: The _Types_ section in this main RAML file actually is empty. It includes the various type files in the `Libraries` directory.  
_Note 2_: Currently, the generated HTML documentation does not contain tables that describe the data types. However, their content can be seen in the response tabs of the requests. If you want to have a detailed look at the type definitions, open the RAML files in the _Libraries_ directory.
* The _/dd/2.0_ resources section describes the available end-points.

See the figure below for an overview of the various resource objects and their relations.
